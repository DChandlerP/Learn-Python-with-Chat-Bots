        "Data types in Python are categories of data that define the characteristics and operations that can be performed on them. Python has several built-in data types that are commonly used in programming. Some of them are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numeric types**: These are types that represent numbers, such as integers (**int**), floating-point numbers (**float**), and complex numbers (**complex**). For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "x = 10 # int\n",
        "y = 3.14 # float\n",
        "z = 2 + 3j # complex\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **String type**: This is a type that represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, such as \"Hello\" or 'Python'. Strings can be concatenated, sliced, formatted, and manipulated in various ways. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "s = \"Hello\" # string\n",
        "t = s + \" world\" # concatenation\n",
        "u = t[0:5] # slicing\n",
        "v = f\"{s} {t}\" # formatting\n",
        "w = s.upper() # method\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sequence types**: These are types that represent ordered collections of items, such as lists (**list**), tuples (**tuple**), and ranges (**range**). Sequences can be indexed, iterated, sliced, and modified (except for tuples and ranges, which are immutable). For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "a = [1, 2, 3] # list\n",
        "b = (4, 5, 6) # tuple\n",
        "c = range(7, 10) # range\n",
        "d = a[0] # indexing\n",
        "e = sum(b) # iteration\n",
        "f = c[1:3] # slicing\n",
        "a.append(4) # modification\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Binary types**: These are types that represent sequences of bytes or bits, such as bytes (**bytes**), byte arrays (**bytearray**), and memory views (**memoryview**). Binary types can be used to handle raw binary data, such as images, files, or network packets. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "g = b\"Hello\" # bytes\n",
        "h = bytearray(g) # bytearray\n",

        "i[2:4] = b\"LL\" # slicing\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mapping type**: This is a type that represents an unordered collection of key-value pairs, such as dictionaries (**dict**). Mappings can be used to store and retrieve data by using keys as indexes. Keys must be immutable and unique, while values can be any data type. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "k = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25} # dict\n",
        "l = k[\"name\"] # indexing\n",
        "k[\"age\"] = 26 # modification\n",
        "k[\"gender\"] = \"female\" # addition\n",
        "del k[\"gender\"] # deletion\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Boolean type**: This is a type that represents a logical value of either True or False. Booleans can be used to perform conditional tests and logical operations. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "m = True # bool\n",
        "n = False # bool\n",
        "o = m and n # logical operation\n",
        "p = m or n # logical operation\n",

        "r = m == n # comparison operation\n",
        "s = 10 > 5 # comparison operation\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Set types**: These are types that represent unordered collections of unique items, such as sets (**set**) and frozen sets (**frozenset**). Sets can be used to perform mathematical operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. Frozen sets are immutable versions of sets. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "t = {1, 2, 3} # set\n",
        "u = frozenset({4, 5, 6}) # frozenset\n",
        "v = t | u # union operation\n",
        "w = t & u # intersection operation \n",
        "x = t - u # difference operation \n",
        "y = t ^ u # symmetric difference operation \n",
        "z = 1 in t # membership operation \n",
        "t.add(7) # modification \n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "These are some of the most common data types in Python. There are also other data types that are defined by modules or classes, such as dates and times (**datetime**), fractions (**fractions**), decimals (**decimal**), enumerations (**enum**), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to know the data type of any object in Python, you can use the **type()** function. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "type(10) # returns <class 'int'>\n",
        "type(\"Hello\") # returns <class 'str'>\n",

Only one block of code will be executed per iteration. The order of the conditions matters, as the first condition that evaluates to True will be executed and the rest will be skipped.\n",
        "- The first condition we check is if i is divisible by both 3 and 5. To do this, we use the modulo operator (%) which returns the remainder of a division. If the remainder is zero, it means that the number is divisible by the divisor. For example, 15 % 3 == 0 means that 15 is divisible by 3. We use the logical operator and to combine two conditions. If both conditions are True, then the whole expression is True. For example, 15 % 3 == 0 and 15 % 5 == 0 means that 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5. If this condition is True, we print \"FizzBuzz\" and move on to the next iteration.\n",
        "- The second condition we check is if i is divisible by only 3. To do this, we use the same modulo operator (%) and compare it with zero. If this condition is True, we print \"Fizz\" and move on to the next iteration.\n",
